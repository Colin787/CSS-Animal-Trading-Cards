				<p>Today, there are only half as many African lions than there were 25 years ago. Prides are family units that may comprise anywhere from two to 40 lionsâ€”including up to to three or four males, a dozen or so females, and their young. All of a pride's lionesses are related, and female cubs typically stay with the group as they age. In the wild the lifespan of lions is approximately 15 years, however in captivity it can be as long as 30 years.</p>
